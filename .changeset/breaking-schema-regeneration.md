The schema package now publishes declarations generated by `dtsgenerator`. Any consumers relying on the previous `json-schema-to-typescript` output will need to update their imports:

- Update `schema/index.d.ts` references to the new `TokenMemberMap` and `DesignTokenInterchangeFormat` aliases exported from the root entry point.
- Re-run type generation tooling if you forked the old index signature types so your copies no longer assume `$`-prefixed keys satisfy the token index signature.
- Make sure `skipLibCheck` is `false` in your TypeScript project so the new declaration guards catch conflicting token members during compilation.
