'@lapidist/dtif-parser': minor
---

Introduce the canonical DTIF parser package with the full pipeline from loading
and decoding through schema validation, normalisation, graph construction, and
resolution. Ship the `dtif-parse` CLI, document and cache integrations,
configurable resolver depth limits, and plugin hooks that surface extension
results and resolved-token transforms alongside structured diagnostics.
