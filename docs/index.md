## Why teams choose DTIF {#why-dtif}

DTIF defines a common language for design tokens so product teams can ship consistent
experiences faster. The specification separates the data model from implementation
details, enabling design platforms, component libraries, and build tooling to exchange
colour, typography, spacing, motion, and more without loss of fidelity.

### Interoperable structure

- Normalised JSON schema captures token value, metadata, and relationships.
- Clear terminology and architecture make it easy to reason about token inheritance
  and overrides.
- Conformance requirements ensure tokens behave the same across tools and runtimes.

### Extensible taxonomy

- Core token types cover practical scenarios from typography to animation.
- Namespaced extensions allow experimentation while maintaining interoperability.
- The [registry](https://github.com/bylapidist/dtif/tree/main/registry) records approved `$type` identifiers and extensions to
  keep adoption aligned.

### Verified quality

- Schema-backed examples demonstrate real-world documents and edge cases.
- Reference tooling validates documents and serialisation logic during CI.
- Governance processes provide predictable change management and versioning.

## Build faster with ready-to-use assets {#tooling-assets}

Use the curated resources in this repository to streamline implementation and stay in
sync with the standard:

- **Core schema** ‚Äì the canonical [JSON Schema](https://dtif.lapidist.net/schema/core.json) for validators and toolchains.
- **Reference examples** ‚Äì schema-valid [token documents](https://github.com/bylapidist/dtif/tree/main/examples) designed for testing and education.
- **Registry** ‚Äì approved [`$type` identifiers, extensions, and namespaces](https://github.com/bylapidist/dtif/tree/main/registry).
- **Conformance tests** ‚Äì fixtures for verifying implementations and ensuring
  [compatibility](https://github.com/bylapidist/dtif/tree/main/tests).
- **Design Lint** ‚Äì a [DTIF-native CLI](https://design-lint.lapidist.net) for linting
  component codebases and build pipelines.
- **DTIFx Toolkit** ‚Äì a [workflow hub](https://dtifx.lapidist.net/) and [open-source suite](https://github.com/bylapidist/dtifx) for orchestrating DTIF tooling.

Each resource is maintained alongside the specification so updates ship together and
are easy to adopt.

## Governance you can trust {#governance}

DTIF is stewarded through transparent governance procedures that balance forward
momentum with long-term stability. The governance documentation covers proposal
workflow, change control, licensing, and decision-making criteria, giving teams the
assurance they need to plan roadmaps and de-risk adoption.
