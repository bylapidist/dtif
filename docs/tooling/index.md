# Tooling built with DTIF {#tooling-built-with-dtif}

Explore DTIF-aware tooling that accelerates production workflows and keeps design tokens
aligned across platforms.

## CLI and automation {#cli-and-automation}

- [Design Lint](./design-lint.md#design-lint) – lint component libraries and build
  pipelines with a DTIF-native command-line interface.

## Parser internals {#parser-internals}

- [DTIF parser guide](../guides/dtif-parser.md#dtif-parser-guide)
  – survey the `@lapidist/dtif-parser` entry points, session lifecycle, and tests before
  landing roadmap work.
