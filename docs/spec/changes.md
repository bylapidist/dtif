Collections of tokens- including the document root and nested groups-
_MUST_ list their non-`$` members in lexicographic order
so diffs remain stable. Within typed value objects this specification defines canonical
property sequences (for example `dimensionType`, `value`,
`unit`) and those canonical orders _MUST_ take precedence
over naive lexical sorting. Collections _MAY_ be versioned using
Semantic Versioning at the document level. Tools _SHOULD_ compute
`$hash` values and lint and validate documents in continuous integration
pipelines.
