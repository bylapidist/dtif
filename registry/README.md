# DTIF Registry

This directory documents registered `$type` identifiers and `$extensions` namespaces.

The `types.json` file lists all builtâ€‘in `$type` values provided by the `net.lapidist.dtif` vendor, including every token type defined by the core specification.

Entries MUST include owner, contact, and a canonical specification reference (a full URL). Submissions follow the process in `docs/governance/`.
