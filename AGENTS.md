# AGENTS

This repository targets **Node.js 22** (with npm 10 or newer). Match the tooling version locally to avoid drift from CI.

All published workspaces adhere to strict [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Pick the appropriate bump size whenever you
prepare a release.

## Before committing

1. Ensure dependencies are installed via `npm install` (or `npm ci` for a clean install).
2. Run — and make sure you pass — the following checks:
   - `npm run format:check`
   - `npm run lint`
   - `npm run lint:ts` whenever you touch JavaScript or TypeScript sources
   - `npm test`
   - `npm run lint:docs` if you change files inside `docs/`
3. When you modify the schema or validator packages, run `npm run build:packages` to confirm the generated artefacts stay in sync.
4. If you touch the documentation site configuration (`docs/.vitepress`) or content that should build statically, run `npm run docs:build` before submitting.

## Changesets and releases

- Every user-visible feature or fix requires a changeset written with `npm run changeset`.
- Choose the correct semver bump for the affected packages (typically `@lapidist/dtif-schema`, `@lapidist/dtif-validator`, and/or `@lapidist/dtif-parser`).
- Keep the autogenerated front matter and provide a concise summary of the change in the body.

## Commit guidelines

- Follow the Conventional Commits convention (`type(scope): description`).
- Keep commits focused and avoid bundling unrelated changes.

## Additional notes

- Use `npm run format` to apply project formatting when needed.
- Do not disable lint rules via inline comments; code must satisfy ESLint/markdownlint without overrides.
- Prefer precise TypeScript typings — avoid casting to `any` or other broad assertions unless absolutely necessary.
