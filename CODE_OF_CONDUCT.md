# Code of Conduct

This project follows the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).

- **Be respectful and inclusive.** Assume good intent, use welcoming language, and be mindful of differing skill levels and backgrounds.
- **No harassment or discrimination.** Offensive or exclusionary behaviour (verbal or written) is not tolerated in any project space.
- **Prioritise collaboration.** Offer constructive feedback, accept input graciously, and seek consensus when disagreements arise.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and interactions, including issues, discussions, pull requests, documentation, real-time chats, and community events.

## Reporting

If you observe or experience unacceptable behaviour:

- Prefer a **private report** by emailing the maintainers at [conduct@lapidist.net](mailto:conduct@lapidist.net).
- If email is not possible, open a GitHub issue labelled `code-of-conduct` with only the information required to contact you; maintainers will follow up privately.

Reports will be reviewed promptly and handled confidentially. Consequences may include warnings, temporary bans, or removal from the community depending on severity.
